# MC-1-Motor-Cortex-Model

These are bi-directional neural waveform to motion models. They are trained using Motor Cortex 1 neural waveforms from 64 electrodes of a rhesus macaque monkey.

## Results
The difference between the reconstructed input physical coordinate from the test set is 0.001 units different that the original after being reconstructed via synthetic waveform.
