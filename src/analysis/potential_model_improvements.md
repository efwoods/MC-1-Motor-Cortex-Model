## 1. **Expand and Diversify the Training Data**

**Problem:** Your model only learns "table-to-mouth" dynamics and doesn’t understand the broader **manifold of plausible motion**.

**Solution:**

- Add **synthetic trajectories** like spirals, circles, and arcs that follow similar kinematic properties.
- Add **perturbed real-world trajectories**: jitter, rotations, time warp, and noise-injection.
- Consider using **adversarial examples**: slightly altered real trajectories to challenge the model’s assumptions.

## 2. **Use a Better Loss Function**

If you're just using Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and true positions, the model may optimize for proximity but not for **trajectory shape or smoothness**.

**Improved Losses:**

- **Velocity and acceleration loss**: Add a penalty on the differences in velocity or acceleration between predicted and true paths.
- **Dynamic Time Warping loss (DTW)**: Helps match predicted motion to true motion even if there's misalignment.
- **Chamfer Distance / Earth Mover's Distance**: Useful if you're representing positions as point clouds or trajectory samples.

## 3. **Use Temporal Encodings or Recurrent Models**

**Problem:** A static or frame-wise model may lack the context of **how motion evolves over time**.

**Solution:**

- Use **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** like LSTMs or GRUs.
- Use **Transformers with temporal positional encoding** (best for large datasets).
- Use **convolutional temporal encoders** (e.g., 1D CNNs across time axis).

These approaches capture dynamics like acceleration, directional change, and momentum.

## 4. **Self-Supervised Learning for Motion Representations**

**Problem:** Your model may only be learning mappings in a supervised context and lacks general structural understanding.

**Solution:**

- Pretrain a model to learn **motion embeddings** from unlabeled data.
- Use **contrastive learning**:
    - Positive pair: two augmentations of the same trajectory.
    - Negative pair: different trajectories.

Then fine-tune on the supervised task.

## 5. **Use Domain Adaptation / Domain Generalization**

You're effectively asking your model to generalize from **domain A** (table-to-mouth) to **domain B** (spiral motion). This is a classic **domain generalization** problem.

**Solutions:**

- **Domain randomization**: Randomly vary the data’s appearance, trajectory shape, and noise conditions during training.
- **Feature alignment**: Use adversarial domain adaptation (e.g., DANN) to force latent features to be invariant across domains.

## 6. **Regularization Techniques**

- Use **Dropout** and **BatchNorm** to reduce overfitting to specific trajectory types.
- Add **Jacobian norm regularization**: Encourages smooth mappings between input and output by penalizing high gradients in the function.
